## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create .env file at the same level with package.json and update the credential, these are the parameters:
ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE = "your_namespace"
ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION = "your_db_name"
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT = "your_db_api_endpoint"
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "your_db_token"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key


Run the script, but notice that the script is not efficient yet to scrape good data
for our prompt questions. Will need to optimized it to make the chatbot functional.
However, we have working prototype currently and the loadDb.ts will be updated.
P.S. Running current script will cost 0.02 $usd (by Dec 11, 2024)

```bash
npm run seed
```

Then, run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

for future production: 
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Scripts

```bash
dev - Start development server
build - Build for production
start - Start production server
lint - Run linter
seed - Seed database
```
